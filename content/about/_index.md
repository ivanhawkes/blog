<h2 class="title text-center">About Us</h2>

We're a small company who work with interactive game technologies. This is primarily done in the spare hours of the people involved and it's always a passion project. That passion to create is what relentlessly drives us all forward.

Our core work is based upon the bedrock of [CRYENGINE](https://www.cryengine.com/), a high end game engine and renderer. Our founder, [Ivan Hawkes](/profile/ivan-hawkes/), is working with artists and game designers to help build several projects.

You can learn more about our internal projects on our [projects pages](/project/).

We are also involved in some external projects:
